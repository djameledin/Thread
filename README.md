## Introduction 
**Thread** is a **mini file-based** programming language. Instead of **writing code inside files**, you encode the program directly in the **filename**. The file must be **empty**, and its name defines the syntax.

### How it Works
**File name**: Syntax must be respected ending with .th extension,
example:
```thread
return(type["content"], Output.commands).th
```
 content --> Respect quotation marks when printing text.
 
 [commands](threads/basis/direction.md)   --> It gives character to the content and should start with "Output".

 
**File empty**: the file content must be empty.
